// Have this file include/do anything to set up your php codebase environment.

// of your repo periodically too, to get the benefits of phpsh ctags
// integration.

// You may make use of the string $___phpsh___codebase_mode which may be
// specified on phpsh startup via -c.  The string is '' by default.


// E_ALL catches certain coding errors and we recommend it.  Comment this out
// if it produces too many warnings you don't have time to fix.
// You could also try moving it to the bottom of this file, after you load your
// codebase libraries, to have fewer pre-existing warnings show up, but still
// get added safety in phpsh.
