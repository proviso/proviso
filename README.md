Proviso aims to be an SDK+API to provision platform-independent local
VMs for Drupal development. The project seeks to develop an extensible
framework and ecosystem for developers to achieve parity with multiple
production deployment targets, as well as a one-click installer control
panel that makes advanced local development accessible.
